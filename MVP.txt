What your app should do (MVP that actually helps)
1) Meter register (the foundation)

Scheme → blocks → units → meter numbers

Meter type: bulk / unit / common property

Photos of meter + location notes

Multipliers (if any), last reading, status (active/faulty/inaccessible)

2) Mobile readings (Antonio-proof)

Offline-capable capture

Mandatory photo per reading (timestamped)

Auto validation:

reading must be ≥ last reading

flag spikes/drops vs last 3 months

Route list + “meters not read” exceptions

3) Allocation engine (the “math” Zerilda shouldn’t be doing manually)

Support multiple methods:

Metered: unit kWh × tariff

Bulk reconciliation: bulk – sum(units) = common + losses

Apportionment fallback: split by PQ or equal units

Estimations (with rules + auto “true-up” next month)

4) Billing outputs + reporting

Export to their finance system (CSV for now is fine).

Trustee dashboard:

total kWh, cost, variance month-on-month

top 10 consumers

abnormal usage flags

common area consumption trend (often where theft/leaks show up)

5) Dispute pack generator (massive time saver)

One click → PDF pack:

last 6 readings + photos

tariff used + source

calculation steps

contact log

That’s how you make trustees feel safe, and owners calm down.
