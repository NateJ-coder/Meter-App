### Step 2: Create Your Scheme

A "scheme" is the property or location where you manage meters.

**Example:** "Oak Gardens Complex" or "Main Street Building"

✏️ **Fill in:**
- Scheme name (e.g., "Oak Gardens Complex")

➡️ Click **Next**

✏️ **For each building:**
- Enter building name
- Click "**+ Add Building**"

You can add as many buildings as you need. When done, click **Next**.

### Step 4: Add Units

Units are the individual spaces being metered (apartments, shops, offices).

**Examples:**
- "Unit 101", "Unit 102"
- "Shop 1", "Shop 2"
- "Office A", "Office B"

✏️ **For each unit:**

### Step 5: Register Meters

Now link physical meters to your units.

#### Bulk Meter (Main Supply)

This is the meter that tracks total consumption for the entire property.

✏️ **Fill in:**
- Meter number (e.g., "M-2024-001")
- Initial reading (optional, defaults to 0)

Click "**+ Add Bulk Meter**"

#### Unit Meters (Individual)

These meters track consumption for each unit.

✏️ **For each meter:**
- Select building (this filters the unit list)
- Select unit
- Enter meter number (e.g., "M-2024-101")
- Initial reading (optional)

Click "**+ Add Unit Meter**"

💡 **Tip:** The system will warn you if you enter a duplicate meter number.

When done, click **Next**.

---

### Step 6: Readiness Check

The system will now verify your setup is complete.

**You'll see:**
- ✓ Buildings added
- ✓ Units added
- ✓ Meters registered
- ✓ No duplicate meter numbers
- ✓ All units have meters

**If any issues are found**, the system will show them and let you go back to fix them.

**If everything looks good**, click **Next**.

---

### Step 7: Open Your First Reading Cycle

A "cycle" is a billing period (usually monthly).

✏️ **Fill in:**
- Start date (e.g., January 1, 2026)
- End date (e.g., January 31, 2026)

Click "**Open Cycle**"

## Capturing Your First Readings

### Step 1: Go to Reading Cycle Page

Click "**Reading Cycle**" in the navigation bar.

### Step 2: Find a Meter

You'll see a list of all meters that need readings.

**Use the filters** to narrow down:
- Filter by Building
- Filter by Status (Not Read / Read / Flagged)

### Step 3: Capture Reading

Click "**Capture Reading**" next to any meter.

**You'll see:**
- Meter number and location
- Previous reading (if available)
- Expected usage range (after a few months of history)

**Enter:**
- Current meter reading (in kWh)
- Reading date
- Notes (optional)

**As you type**, the system will show you:
- ✓ "Within typical range" (if normal)
- ⚠ "Higher than usual" (if above average)
- ⚠ "Backward reading" (if lower than previous)

**Don't worry about warnings** - you can still save the reading. The system just wants you to know it'll be reviewed.

Click "**Save Reading**"

### Step 4: Repeat for All Meters

Continue capturing readings for all meters.

**Progress is shown on the dashboard:**
```
Meters Read: 24 / 48
Not Read: 24
```

## Closing Your First Cycle

### When You're Ready

When all readings are captured (or as many as possible), go back to the **Reading Cycle** page.

Click "**Close Cycle**"

### What Happens Next

A **cycle closure summary** will appear showing:

```
📊 Summary
✓ Units Read: 48/48 (100%)
✓ Missing Readings: None
✓ Flagged Readings: 3 readings
```

**If everything looks good**, click "**Close Cycle**"

**If readings are missing** or flagged, you can:
- Go back and capture missing readings
- Review flagged readings
- Or close anyway (late readings can still be added)

### After Closing

**Your checklist will update:**
```
✓ Close First Cycle
100% Complete 🎉
```

You can now dismiss the checklist. It won't appear again.

## Common Questions

### Can I change my setup later?

**Yes!** Go to "**Meter Register**" to:
- Add/edit schemes
- Add/edit buildings
- Add/edit units
- Add/edit meters

### What if I make a mistake?

**No problem!** You can:
- Edit readings (before cycle closes)
- Edit meter details anytime
- The setup health panel will catch common errors

### What do the flags mean?

Flags are automatic alerts for unusual readings:

- **Backward reading** - Current reading lower than previous
- **Spike** - Much higher than usual (3× average)
- **Zero consumption** - No usage detected
- **Unchanged** - Same as last reading

**These are just alerts**, not errors. You can review them on the "**Review**" page.

### Can I add readings after closing a cycle?

**Yes, but** they'll be marked as "late additions". It's better to capture all readings before closing.

### What if I have 100+ units?

The system handles large properties:
- Use filters to work by building
- Bulk operations where possible
- Expected ranges help you spot errors quickly

## Next Steps

### After Your First Cycle

**Second cycle** will be easier:
- Setup is complete (no wizard)

3. Review flagged readings
4. Close cycle (end of month)
5. Export data (for billing)
```
