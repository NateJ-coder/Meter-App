## 📞 Support

### For Users
- See `ONBOARDING.md` for complete guide
- See `ONBOARDING_COMPARISON.md` for before/after comparison
- Use `test-onboarding.html` to verify setup

### For Developers
- All modules use ES6 modules
- State stored in localStorage
- Graceful degradation built-in
- Comments throughout code
- No external dependencies

### Troubleshooting

**Wizard doesn't appear:**
- Check if schemes already exist
- Check localStorage for `fuzio_onboarding_state`
- Open test page to verify module loading

**Health panel shows old issues:**
- Panel checks current state on every load
- Fix underlying data (duplicate meters, etc.)
- Refresh page to see updates

**Expected ranges not showing:**
- Ranges only appear after 3 cycles with data
- First cycle will show "No historical data yet"
- Check if meter has consumption history
