# Testing Checklist

## 🚀 Quick Start

All three requested features have been implemented:

1. **Login System** - Prevents re-onboarding for returning users
2. **User Recording** - Tracks who captured each meter reading
3. **Developer Console** - Admin dashboard for user management and system health

---

## ✅ Test 1: Authentication Flow

### Steps:
1. Open the app in your browser
2. You should be redirected to **login.html**
3. Login with default admin credentials:
   - **Email**: `admin@fuzio.com`
   - **Password**: `admin123`
4. After successful login, you should be redirected to the **dashboard (index.html)**
5. Check the **top-right navbar**:
   - You should see your name: "👤 Administrator"
   - A "🚪 Logout" button
   - A "🔧 Dev" link (admin only)

### Expected Results:
- ✅ Login redirects to dashboard
- ✅ Navbar shows user information
- ✅ Logout button is visible
- ✅ Dev console link appears for admins

---

## ✅ Test 2: Developer Console

### Steps:
1. As an admin, click the **"🔧 Dev"** link in the navbar
2. Explore the 5 sections:
   - **Health Dashboard** - Shows app metrics and any issues
   - **User Management** - Add/delete users
   - **Activity Log** - Recent user actions
   - **Data Statistics** - Schemes, meters, readings counts
   - **System Actions** - Reset onboarding, clear data, export backup

### Test User Management:
1. Click **"Add New User"** button
2. Fill out the form:
   - Name: "John Doe"
   - Email: "john@example.com"
   - Password: "test123"
   - Role: "Field Worker"
3. Click **"Create User"**
4. Check if the user appears in the user list
5. Check the **Activity Log** - should show "user_created" action

### Test System Actions:
1. Try **"Export Data Backup"** - should download a JSON file
2. View the exported file to see all your data

### Expected Results:
- ✅ Dev console accessible only to admins
- ✅ User creation works
- ✅ Activity log shows new actions
- ✅ Data export downloads successfully

---

## ✅ Test 3: User Recording

### Steps:
1. Navigate to **Reading Cycle** page
2. Click **"Start Reading Cycle"** for any scheme
3. Capture a manual reading:
   - Enter a meter value
   - Upload a photo (optional)
   - Submit the reading
4. Go to **Review** page
5. Find the reading you just captured
6. Click **"Review"** to see details

### Expected Results:
- ✅ Reading is captured successfully
- ✅ Review modal shows **"Captured By: Administrator"**
- ✅ User name appears in the reading details

### Test Other Capture Methods:
1. **On-Site Mode**:
   - Go to Reading Cycle
   - Click "Start On-Site Mode"
   - Capture a reading
   - Verify user is recorded

2. **QR Code Reader**:
   - Go to reader.html with a QR code
   - Capture a reading
   - Verify user shows as "Administrator (QR)"

---

## ✅ Test 4: Session Persistence

### Steps:
1. After logging in, **close the browser**
2. **Reopen the browser** and navigate to the app
3. You should be automatically logged in (no redirect to login page)
4. Check navbar - should still show your user name

### Expected Results:
- ✅ Session persists across browser refreshes
- ✅ No need to log in again
- ✅ Returning users skip onboarding

---

## ✅ Test 5: Role-Based Access

### Steps:
1. In dev console, create a **Field Worker** user:
   - Name: "Jane Worker"
   - Email: "jane@example.com"
   - Password: "worker123"
   - Role: "Field Worker"
2. Logout from admin account
3. Login as **jane@example.com / worker123**
4. Check the navbar - **Dev console link should NOT appear**
5. Try to manually navigate to **dev-console.html**
6. You should see: "Access Denied. Admins only."

### Expected Results:
- ✅ Field workers can't see dev console link
- ✅ Direct access to dev-console.html is blocked
- ✅ Only admins have full access

---

## 🎨 Test 6: Visual Styling

### Login Page (login.html):
- ✅ Blue gradient background
- ✅ Centered white card with Fuzio logo
- ✅ Form fields with blue accents
- ✅ Shake animation on error

### Dev Console (dev-console.html):
- ✅ Health metrics in grid layout
- ✅ Green success badges, red warning badges
- ✅ Activity log with timestamps
- ✅ Stats cards with blue/green/orange colors
- ✅ System actions with hover effects

### Navbar (all pages):
- ✅ User name with person icon (👤)
- ✅ Logout button (🚪)
- ✅ Dev console link for admins (🔧)

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Login page styles look broken
**Fix**: Check if CSS was properly added to styles.css (lines 1963-2125)

### Issue: "auth is not defined" error
**Fix**: Ensure all pages import auth.js:
```javascript
import { auth } from './assets/auth.js';
window.auth = auth;
```

### Issue: User not tracked in readings
**Fix**: Check browser console for errors. Ensure auth.getCurrentUser() is called before saving readings.

### Issue: Dev console shows "no data"
**Fix**: Capture some readings first. Dev console needs existing data to display statistics.

## 📚 Documentation

For detailed documentation, see:
- **AUTH_GUIDE.md** - Complete guide to authentication system
- **STORAGE_ARCHITECTURE.md** - Cloud migration guide
- **README.md** - General app documentation

---

## 🎉 Success Criteria

All features working if:
1. ✅ Login system prevents unauthorized access
2. ✅ Returning users skip onboarding
3. ✅ All readings show who captured them
4. ✅ Dev console accessible only to admins
5. ✅ User management works (add/delete)
6. ✅ Activity log tracks all user actions
7. ✅ Sessions persist across browser refreshes

---

## 🔐 Default Credentials

**Admin Account** (auto-created on first load):
- Email: `admin@fuzio.com`
- Password: `admin123`

**Note**: This is a localStorage-based prototype. Passwords are stored in plain text. For production deployment, implement proper backend authentication with encrypted passwords.

---

## 🚨 Known Limitations

1. **Security**: Plain text passwords in localStorage (prototyping only)
2. **No password recovery**: If you forget password, you'll need to clear localStorage
3. **No session expiry**: Sessions persist indefinitely until logout
4. **Single device**: Auth doesn't sync across multiple devices
5. **localStorage limits**: Typically 5-10MB depending on browser

For production deployment, migrate to cloud backend (see STORAGE_ARCHITECTURE.md).

---

## 📞 Support

If you encounter any issues during testing:
1. Open browser console (F12) and check for errors
2. Try clearing localStorage and starting fresh
3. Verify all files were saved correctly
4. Check AUTH_GUIDE.md for troubleshooting steps

**Happy Testing! 🎉**
